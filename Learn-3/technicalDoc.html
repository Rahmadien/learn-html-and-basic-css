                <p>You need installed Java First.</p>
                <p>Some PCs might have Java already installed. To check if you have Java installed on a Windows PC, search in the start bar for Java or type the following in Command Prompt (cmd.exe):</p>
                <code>
                    C:\Users\Your Name>java -version
                </code>
                <p>If Java is installed, you will see something like this (depending on version):</p>
                <code>
                    java version "11.0.1" 2018-10-16 LTS<br>
                    Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment 18.9 (build 11.0.1+13-LTS)<br>
                    Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 18.9 (build 11.0.1+13-LTS, mixed mode)
                </code>
                <p>If you do not have Java installed on your computer, you can download it for free at <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-se-glance.html">oracle.com</a>.</p>
                <p>In Java, every application begins with a class name, and that class must match the filename.
                    Let's create our first Java file, called Main.java, which can be done in any text editor (like Notepad).
                    The file should contain a "Hello World" message, which is written with the following code:</p>
                    <code>
                        public class Main {<br>
                            public static void main(String[] args) {<br>
                              System.out.println("Hello World");
                            }<br>
                        }
                    </code>
                <p>Save the code in Notepad as "Main.java". Open Command Prompt (cmd.exe), navigate to the directory where you saved your file, and type "javac Main.java":</p>
                <code>
                    C:\Users\Your Name>javac Main.java
                </code>
                <p>This will compile your code. If there are no errors in the code, the command prompt will take you to the next line. Now, type "java Main" to run the file:</p>
                <code>
                    C:\Users\Your Name>java Main
                </code>
                <p>The output should read:</p>
                <code>Hello World</code>
            </article>

            <article>
                <p>The main() method is required and you will see it in every Java program:</p>
                <code>
                    public static void main(String[] args)
                </code>
                <p>Any code inside the main() method will be executed. Don't worry about the keywords before and after main. You will get to know them bit by bit while reading this tutorial. For now, just remember that every Java program has a class name which must match the filename, and that every program must contain the main() method.</p>
                <p>Inside the main() method, we can use the println() method to print a line of text to the screen:</p>
                <code>
                    public static void main(String[] args) {<br>
                        System.out.println("Hello World");
                      }
                </code>

        <section class="main-section" id="java_variables">
            <header>Java Variables</header>
            <article>
                <p>Variables are containers for storing data values.</p>
                <p>In Java, there are different types of variables, for example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>String - stores text, such as "Hello". String values are surrounded by double quotes</li>
                    <li>int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123</li>
                    <li>float - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99</li>
                    <li>char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes</li>
                    <li>boolean - stores values with two states: true or false</li>
                </ul>
                <p>To create a variable, you must specify the type and assign it a value:</p>
                <code>
                    type variableName = value;
                </code>
                <p>Where <i>type</i> is one of Java's types (such as int or String), and variableName is the name of the variable (such as x or name). The equal sign is used to assign values to the variable.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="java_array">
            <header>Java Array</header>
            <article>
                <p>Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, instead of declaring separate variables for each value. To declare an array, define the variable type with square brackets:</p>
                <code>String[] cars;</code>
                <p>We have now declared a variable that holds an array of strings. To insert values to it, you can place the values in a comma-separated list, inside curly braces:</p>
                <code>String[] cars = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"};</code>
                <p>To create an array of integers, you could write:</p>
                <code>int[] myNum = {10, 20, 30, 40};</code>

        <section class="main-section" id="java_if_else">
            <header>Java If Else</header>
            <article>
                <p>You already know that Java supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Less than: a < b</li>
                    <li>Less than or equal to: a <= b</li>
                    <li>Greater than: a > b</li>
                    <li>Greater than or equal to: a >= b</li>
                    <li>Equal to a == b</li>
                    <li>Not Equal to: a != b</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You can use these conditions to perform different actions for different decisions.</p>
                <p>Java has the following conditional statements:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true</li>
                    <li>Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false</li>
                    <li>Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false</li>
                    <li>Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Use the if statement to specify a block of Java code to be executed if a condition is true.</p>
                <code>if (condition) {<br>
                    // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
                  }</code>
                <p>Use the else statement to specify a block of code to be executed if the condition is false.</p>
                <code>
                    if (condition) {<br>
                        // block of code to be executed if the condition is true br
                      } else { <br>
                        // block of code to be executed if the condition is false <br>
                      }
                </code>
                <p>Use the else if statement to specify a new condition if the first condition is false.</p>
                <code>
                    if (condition1) { <br>
                        // block of code to be executed if condition1 is true <br>
                      } else if (condition2) { <br>
                        // block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is true <br>
                      } else { <br>
                        // block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is false <br>
                      }

        <section class="main-section" id="java_method">
            <header>Java Method</header>
            <article>
                <p>A method is a block of code which only runs when it is called. You can pass data, known as parameters, into a method. Methods are used to perform certain actions, and they are also known as functions. Why use methods? To reuse code: define the code once, and use it many times.</p>
                <p>A method must be declared within a class. It is defined with the name of the method, followed by parentheses (). Java provides some pre-defined methods, such as System.out.println(), but you can also create your own methods to perform certain actions:</p>
                <code>
                    public class Main {<br>
                        static void myMethod() {<br>
                          // code to be executed
                        } <br>
                      }
                </code>
                <ul>
                    <li>myMethod() is the name of the method</li>
                    <li>static means that the method belongs to the Main class and not an object of the Main class. You will learn more about objects and how to access methods through objects later in this tutorial.</li>
                    <li>void means that this method does not have a return value. You will learn more about return values later in this chapter</li>
                </ul>
                <p>To call a method in Java, write the method's name followed by two parentheses () and a semicolon;</p>
                <p>In the following example, myMethod() is used to print a text (the action), when it is called:</p>
                <code>
                    public class Main {<br>
                        static void myMethod() {<br>
                          System.out.println("I just got executed!");<br>
                        }
                      <br>
                        public static void main(String[] args) {<br>
                          myMethod();<br>
                        } <br>
                      } <br>
                      
                      // Outputs "I just got executed!"

            <article>
                <p>OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.</p>
                <p>Procedural programming is about writing procedures or methods that perform operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and methods.</p>
                <p>Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>OOP is faster and easier to execute</li>
                    <li>OOP provides a clear structure for the programs</li>
                    <li>OOP helps to keep the Java code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug</li>
                    <li>OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time</li>
                </ul>
